# OntoGen V0.2.0

OntoGen is an OntoAgent rendering service and reasoning module for generating natural language utterances. This version rewrites OntoGen v0.0.3 and provides an OntoAgentReasoningModule for OntoAgent v4.2.X integration.

This is still very much a work in progress. A lot of code is being rewritten from scratch to incorporate our new construction-driven model and improve on some faults from the last version.
